# Netflix Automation Project

## Description

This project is an automation framework built for testing the **Netflix Web Application** using **Selenium WebDriver**, **Cucumber**, and **Java**. The primary objective of this framework is to ensure that Netflix's key functionality, like navigating the website, verifying elements, language switching, and login functionality, work as expected across various browsers. The project is built with a focus on reusability, maintainability, and readability. 

The automation script simulates a user journey through the Netflix homepage, validates different elements (like the logo and buttons), and performs interactions like changing the language, verifying different UI elements, and clicking on different parts of the page. This helps in quickly identifying issues with the website's user interface and functionality.

### Technologies Used
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A powerful tool for controlling browsers programmatically.
- **Cucumber**: A tool for running automated tests written in plain language (Gherkin).
- **Java**: Programming language for writing test scripts.
- **JUnit**: Testing framework used to run and validate tests.
- **Maven**: Dependency management tool.
- **WebDriverWait**: To wait for elements to be visible or clickable.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern used for maintaining test scripts efficiently.
